# Programming 3 group project: NysseMeni game

The main idea of the project was to implement a small game using C++. The course provided the base for getting real time data of busses around Tampere and moving the busses on the map (CourseLib part) and rest of the game implementation was left for the students.

**See project documentation under /Documentation folder (in Finnish)**

Project collaborators and work division:
- Heidi Seppi: Tracking of game statistics and winning/ending dialogs
- Ella: Game mechanics
Also some parts (like createGame and gameEngine) were done together.

**Running the project: Project was implemented and run using Qt Creator (on linux virtual desktop).**
